These notes are highlighting statements from the courses notes, which are interesting, or invoke an emotion in me. I will also give my own comments. Everything in quotations are from the [lecture's notes](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-045j-automata-computability-and-complexity-spring-2011/resources/mit6_045js11_lec01/), unless otherwise specified.

What is computer science?

> "We claim that computer science is a mathematical set of tools, or body of ideas, for understanding just about any system—brain, universe, living organism, or, yes, computer."

This intrugues me because it is the exact reason why I decided to study this course, to try and apply programing to topics which I find interesting, trying to really practice, the science of computing.

To quote Feynman, > "What I cannot build, I do not understand."

> "A quine is a program that prints itself out."

> "This is a taste of the weird things that turn out to be possible. Later, we’ll see how to convince someone of a statement without giving them any idea why it’s true, or the ability to convince other people that the statement is true. We’ll see how to “compile” any proof into a special format such that anyone who wants to check the proof only has to check a few random bits—regardless of the size of the proof!—to be extremely confident that it’s correct. That these counterintuitive things are possible is a discovery about how the world works. Of course, not everyone has the interest to go into these ideas in technical detail, just as not everyone is going to seriously study quantum mechanics. But in Scott’s opinion, any scientifically educated person should at least be aware that these great ideas exist."
