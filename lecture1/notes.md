These notes are highlighting statements from the courses notes, which are interesting, or invoke an emotion in me. I will also give my own comments. Everything in quotations are from the [lecture's notes](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-045j-automata-computability-and-complexity-spring-2011/resources/mit6_045js11_lec01/), unless otherwise specified.

What is computer science?
---
"We claim that computer science is a mathematical set of
tools, or body of ideas, for understanding just about any systemâ€”brain, universe, living organism, or, yes, computer."

This intrugues me because it is the exact reason why I decided to study this course, to try and apply programing to topics which I find interesting, trying to really practice, the science of computing.

To quote Feynman, "What I cannot build, I do not understand."
